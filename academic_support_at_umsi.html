                <h2>Internships</h2>
                <p>We recommend all students to participate in an internship (for credit or not) for a number of reasons. First, it gives you the opportunity to see the results of the skills you’re building in real-world situations. Second, it gives you a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the field, which you bring back to your second-year coursework. Third, it allows you to build experience, as well as a stronger resume and/or portfolio, which future employers look for. And finally, we know that the connections made during internships are critical for networking and can lead to job offers.</p>
